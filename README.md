 ## Getting Started
 
## Prerequisites

####   Make sure that you have Python 3 and the Pytube library installed on your system. If you don't have Pytube installed, you can install it using the following command:

        pip install pytube 

## **Installing**

####  1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
####  2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you cloned or downloaded the repository.
####  3. Run the following command to start the script:

         python vidlistloader.py




## **Usage**

####  1. When prompted, enter the URL of the YouTube playlist that you want to download.
####  2. When prompted, enter the desired quality of the videos (e.g. 720p, 480p, etc.).
####  3. When prompted, enter the destination folder where you want the videos to be downloaded.
####  4. Wait for the script to finish downloading all the videos.





## **Error Handling**

#### The script has basic error handling to handle exceptions that can occur while downloading the videos such as network errors, timeout errors, etc. If an error occurs, the script will print an error message and move on to the next video.






## **Limitations**

 ####  The script only downloads videos that are publicly available on YouTube.
####   The script may not work for playlists with a large number of videos due to YouTube's API restrictions.
